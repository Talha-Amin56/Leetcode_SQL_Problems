# SQL_Problems

## Overview

The `SQL_Problems` repository is a collection of SQL practice problems designed to help individuals improve their SQL skills, from basic queries to more advanced scenarios. It provides various challenges that cover key concepts in SQL, including data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, window functions, and more.

The problems are organized into categories, such as **Basic SQL**, **Joins**, **Aggregation**, **Subqueries**, and **Advanced SQL**. Each problem comes with a detailed explanation, solution, and example output. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience with SQL, enabling learners to understand and apply SQL techniques to real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders based on the types of SQL problems. Each folder contains `.sql` files with the problems and solutions, along with a `README.md` that explains the concepts covered. Here is an overview of the structure:

## Problem Categories

### 1. **Basic SQL**

This section focuses on fundamental SQL queries, covering essential operations like:
- Retrieving data using `SELECT`
- Filtering data using `WHERE`
- Sorting data with `ORDER BY`
- Using `DISTINCT` to get unique records
- Using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)

### 2. **Joins**

This section provides problems related to joining multiple tables using different types of joins. You'll practice:
- `INNER JOIN` to retrieve matching rows from both tables
- `LEFT JOIN` to include all rows from the left table, even if there's no match in the right table
- `RIGHT JOIN` to include all rows from the right table, even if there's no match in the left table
- `FULL JOIN` to include all rows from both tables, with NULLs for non-matching rows
- `SELF JOIN` to join a table with itself (useful for hierarchical data)
- `CROSS JOIN` to return the Cartesian product of two tables

### 3. **Aggregation**

In this section, you will learn how to aggregate data to generate summarized reports:
- Using aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`)
- Grouping data using `GROUP BY`
- Filtering groups with `HAVING`
- Using `ORDER BY` with aggregated data

### 4. **Subqueries**

This section will help you practice writing subqueries to filter and manipulate data:
- Writing correlated subqueries, where the inner query depends on the outer query
- Writing non-correlated subqueries, where the inner query is independent of the outer query
- Using subqueries with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements

### 5. **Advanced SQL**

This section covers more advanced SQL techniques, including:
- Window Functions for calculating running totals, ranking, and partitioning data
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for writing reusable subqueries
- Recursive queries using CTEs to work with hierarchical or graph-based data
- Complex data transformations using advanced SQL operators
