# Sorting and Grouping Folder

## Overview

This folder contains resources, examples, and problem statements related to sorting and grouping data. These operations are fundamental in data processing, analysis, and database querying.

### Sorting
Sorting involves arranging data in a specified order, either ascending or descending. It is commonly used to:
- Organize data for better readability.
- Prioritize records based on specific criteria (e.g., highest scores or latest dates).
- Enable efficient searching and filtering.

#### Examples of Sorting Use Cases:
- Sorting a list of students by their grades in descending order.
- Arranging products by price in ascending order.
- Ordering transactions by the most recent date.

### Grouping
Grouping aggregates data by common attributes to summarize or analyze patterns. It is typically combined with aggregation functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN`.

#### Examples of Grouping Use Cases:
- Calculating the total sales for each product category.
- Counting the number of users in each region.
- Finding the average score for students grouped by class.

## Folder Contents
This folder includes:
1. **SQL Queries**: Example queries demonstrating sorting and grouping operations.
2. **Problem Statements**: Challenges to practice and improve sorting and grouping skills.
3. **Sample Datasets**: Structured data for hands-on learning and experimentation.

## Applications
Sorting and grouping techniques are widely used in:
- Data analysis and reporting.
- Backend database management for web and mobile applications.
- Business intelligence and decision-making tools.
- Machine learning and data preprocessing tasks.

### Example Problem
**Scenario**: Group a list of employees by their department and calculate the total salary for each department, then sort the departments by total salary in descending order.

Input:
| employee_id | department | salary |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1           | HR         | 5000   |
| 2           | IT         | 7000   |
| 3           | IT         | 8000   |
| 4           | HR         | 6000   |
| 5           | Sales      | 5500   |

Output:
| department | total_salary |
|------------|--------------|
| IT         | 15000        |
| HR         | 11000        |
| Sales      | 5500         |
